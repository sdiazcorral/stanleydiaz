  <h2>My role</h2>
  <p class="no-margin">I was the only designer on this product, which led to me working on all major user-facing properties which include the web app, browser extension, and iOS app. Typical to the small startup life, this role required wearing many hats&mdash;from collaborating with our CEO on defining product features and direction, creating high-fidelity mockups, working with our software engineers and building the front-end of our application, to fixing bugs and creating the occasional marketing ad.</p>
</div>

<div class="text-container">
  <h2>Starting with a redesign</h2>
  <p>I began working on the Papaly web app in 2014. Papaly had already acquired a small loyal following, but there was still an opportunity to make bookmark management even simpler and powerful. The product at the time didn't have a strong sense of consistency in the UI and interaction behavior. In order to base future design projects on a stronger foundation, we decided to begin working on a redesign that would not only polish and update the visual design, but also help restructure the layout to provide a more enjoyable, and simpler user experience. This was also an opportunity to explore the design of new features they had in their product backlog.</p>

  <h2>Dashboard redesign: Goals</h2>
  <p>Apart from the visual refresh, there were a few key areas of the product experience we wanted to focus on for our dashboard redesign. As a bookmark manager, the areas we wanted to focus on were the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Creating new bookmarks should be as frictionless as possible.</li>
    <li>Managing, or moving bookmarks between boards and categories should be simple and intuitive.</li>
    <li>Searching for bookmarks should be quick and easy.</li>
  </ul>
</div>


<div class="text-container bottom-margin-small">
  <h2>Wireframes: Iteration 1</h2>
  <p>For our first iteration of the wireframes, we decided to go with a bit of a liberal approach. Given the UI refresh we wanted to do, as well as some of the new features on our product backlog, these initial wireframes were mostly about exploring a new layout and finding out where some of these new features could exist.</p>
  <p>The wireframes for this first iteration begin to show a new sidebar navigation that has additional pages for exploration to make Papaly a bit more fun and explorative. It also introduces a few new features such as board collaborators, board comments, and board stats. Ultimately, as a product in an early-stage startup, we wanted to increase engagement and daily active users. After discussing with the team, we felt these features would help increase those metrics for various reasons. However, because our primary project at the time was the redesign, we decided not to continue exploring in detail how these features could work. We decided to focus on some of the basics of our product before committing to new features. This would help up speed up the development and release of the new design.</p>

  <h2>Wireframes: Iteration 2, 3, 4</h2>
  <p>The following iterations of the wireframes begin to show some of the functionality of our core product experience such as adding and searching for bookmarks.</p>
  <p>Adding bookmarks was kept to a simple 3-step inline process. We decided to go with this process because it removes a lot of the friction when it comes to adding bookmarks on our website. The inline process keeps the user in the same view while also giving them a contextual view of where they're adding the new bookmark.</p>
  <p>For our search filter functionality, we went through a few iterations that show various ways of presenting the search results to users. The wireframes show various bookmark attributes such as URL, title, and their taxonomy to give users contextual information about the bookmarks they're viewing.</p>
